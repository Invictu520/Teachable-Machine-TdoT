# Teachable-Machine-TdoT

This repo contains a simple html file that links to a Teachable machine model which is (hopefully)
capable of distinguishing between three types of sweets (Nimm2, Fruchtkaramellen, and Maoam)
as well as their respective flavors.

This project was done for TdoT Uni of Hohenheim 2025
